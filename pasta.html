        <h5>- Penne Pasta Dish</h5>
    </div>
    <p>This penne with quick-from-scratch marinara is made with canned tomatoes, tomato paste, and fresh garlic steeped in olive oil to make an all season pasta that’s warm and comforting in the fall and winter but light and bright for spring and summer eats. If you’re looking for a pasta sauce using fresh tomatoes, check out my homemade pomodoro sauce recipe here.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. of Penne Pasta</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>San Marzano style Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Basil or Oregano</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and Freshly ground Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta 2 minutes shy of being al denté. The pasta will continue to cook in the sauce, absorbing the flavors as it does.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Don’t drain the pasta. Instead, transfer the pasta from it’s cooking water directly into the simmering sauce (don’t worry too much about bits of water coming along for the ride.)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Toss the pasta in the sauce and continue to cook until done. If needed, add a few tablespoons of the pasta water to loosen the pasta or if it seems like there won’t be enough. The starch in the sauce helps thicken it as well.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Taste for seasoning, garnish, and serve. Add more salt or red chili flakes if a little more punch is needed, and don’t forget a big bunch of basil.
        </li>

    </ol>
